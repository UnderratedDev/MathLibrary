# MathLibrary

This is a Math Library i am creating for fun in c++. I just love c++ and do not get enough time to use it so i have decided to make a Math Library, and eventually will hope to use it to train a deep learning neural network.

# Running!
    Use the following command, and make sure you have g++ installed
    g++ -std=c++11 -pedantic -W *.cpp -o main && ./main
    
   Currently my cmake file is empty, however in future iterations, i will add one to make building easier.
